    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will practice how to use the MySQL `SELECT` statement which will be extremely useful in your future work as a data analyst/scientist/engineer. **You will use the `publications` database that we used in the *Joins and Relationships* lesson.** In case you haven't had that database, [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/data-static/data/module-1/publications.sql.zip) is the link to download the database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create a `solutions.sql` file in the `your-code` directory to record your solutions to all challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge 1 - Who Have Published What At Where?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge you will write a MySQL `SELECT` query that joins various tables to figure out what titles each author has published at which publishers. Your output should have at least the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `AUTHOR ID` - the ID of the author\n",
    "* `LAST NAME` - author last name\n",
    "* `FIRST NAME` - author first name\n",
    "* `TITLE` - name of the published title\n",
    "* `PUBLISHER` - name of the publisher where the title was published\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output will look something like below:\n",

    "\n",
    "*Hint: In order to count the number of titles published by an author, you need to use [MySQL COUNT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/counting-rows.html). Also check out [MySQL Group By](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by-modifiers.html) because you will count the rows of different groups of data. Refer to the references and learn by yourself. These features will be formally discussed in the Temp Tables and Subqueries lesson.*"
